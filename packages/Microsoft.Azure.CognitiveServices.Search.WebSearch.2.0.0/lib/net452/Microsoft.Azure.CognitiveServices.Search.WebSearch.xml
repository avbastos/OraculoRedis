            The Web Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get
            back search results that include links to webpages, images, and
            more.
            </summary>
            <param name='query'>
            The user's search query term. The term may not be empty. The term
            may contain Bing Advanced Operators. For example, to limit results
            to a specific domain, use the site: operator.
            </param>
            <param name='acceptLanguage'>
            A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user
            interface strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference.
            For additional information, including expected format, see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive;
            do not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify
            the cc query parameter. Bing will use the first supported language
            it finds from the list, and combine that language with the cc
            parameter value to determine the market to return results for. If
            the list does not include a supported language, Bing will find the
            closest language and market that supports the request, and may use
            an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a
            specified one. You should use this header and the cc query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you
            should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. A user interface
            string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface.
            There are very few user interface strings in the JSON response
            objects. Any links in the response objects to Bing.com properties
            will apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='pragma'>
            By default, Bing returns cached content, if available. To prevent
            Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma header to
            no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).
            </param>
            <param name='userAgent'>
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to
            provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although
            optional, you are strongly encouraged to always specify this
            header. The user-agent should be the same string that any commonly
            used browser would send. For information about user agents, see
            [RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight
            assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also,
            Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client
            ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.
            Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
            analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
            improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing
            APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this
            header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests
            for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API
            consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have
            a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
            header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
            NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user
            uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API
            request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent
            HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not
            use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
            device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
            user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If
            the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it
            for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
            the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is
            used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
            information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional,
            you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
            example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address
            results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual
            location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the
            client's geographical location. Bing uses the location information
            to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
            content. Specify the key/value pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;.
            The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
            location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in
            degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and
            less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long
            (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or
            equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the
            coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location
            service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell
            tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since
            January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or
            direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
            from 0 through 360, counting clockwise relative to true north.
            Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The
            horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client
            device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that
            specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this
            key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
            location is especially important if the client's IP address does
            not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for example,
            if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
            this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you
            should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='answerCount'>
            The number of answers that you want the response to include. The
            answers that Bing returns are based on ranking. For example, if
            Bing returns webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches for a
            request and you set this parameter to two (2), the response
            includes webpages and images.If you included the responseFilter
            query parameter in the same request and set it to webpages and
            news, the response would include only webpages.
            </param>
            <param name='countryCode'>
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come
            from. This API supports only the United States market. If you
            specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this
            parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing
            uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list,
            and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine the market to return results for. If the languages list
            does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest
            language and market that supports the request, or it may use an
            aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified
            one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language
            query parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise,
            you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter
            and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify
            both.
            </param>
            <param name='count'>
            The number of search results to return in the response. The default
            is 10 and the maximum value is 50. The actual number delivered may
            be less than requested.Use this parameter along with the offset
            parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
            displays 10 search results per page, set count to 10 and offset to
            0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page,
            increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for
            multiple pages to include some overlap in results.
            </param>
            <param name='freshness'>
            Filter search results by the following age values: Day—Return
            webpages that Bing discovered within the last 24 hours. Week—Return
            webpages that Bing discovered within the last 7 days. Month—Return
            webpages that discovered within the last 30 days. This filter
            applies only to webpage results and not to the other results such
            as news and images. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the
            country where the user is making the request from. However, it
            could be a different country if the user is not located in a
            country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
            &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country code&gt;. For example, en-US. The
            string is case insensitive. If known, you are encouraged to always
            specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the
            request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you
            specify a market that is not listed in Market Codes, Bing uses a
            best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject
            to change. This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually
            exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='offset'>
            The zero-based offset that indicates the number of search results
            to skip before returning results. The default is 0. The offset
            should be less than (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use this
            parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For
            example, if your user interface displays 10 search results per
            page, set count to 10 and offset to 0 to get the first page of
            results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 10 (for
            example, 0, 10, 20). it is possible for multiple pages to include
            some overlap in results.
            </param>
            <param name='promote'>
            A comma-delimited list of answers that you want the response to
            include regardless of their ranking. For example, if you set
            answerCount) to two (2) so Bing returns the top two ranked answers,
            but you also want the response to include news, you'd set promote
            to news. If the top ranked answers are webpages, images, videos,
            and relatedSearches, the response includes webpages and images
            because news is not a ranked answer. But if you set promote to
            video, Bing would promote the video answer into the response and
            return webpages, images, and videos. The answers that you want to
            promote do not count against the answerCount limit. For example, if
            the ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set
            answerCount to 1 and promote to news, the response contains news
            and images. Or, if the ranked answers are videos, images, and news,
            the response contains videos and news. Possible values are
            Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions,
            TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you specify answerCount.
            </param>
            <param name='responseFilter'>
            A comma-delimited list of answers to include in the response. If
            you do not specify this parameter, the response includes all search
            answers for which there's relevant data. Possible filter values are
            Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions,
            TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Although you may use this filter to get
            a single answer, you should instead use the answer-specific
            endpoint in order to get richer results. For example, to receive
            only images, send the request to one of the Image Search API
            endpoints. The RelatedSearches and SpellSuggestions answers do not
            support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API does (only
            the Web Search API returns them). To include answers that would
            otherwise be excluded because of ranking, see the promote query
            parameter.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            A filter used to filter adult content. Off: Return webpages with
            adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages with adult
            text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return
            webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is
            Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
            policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the
            safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query
            operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult
            content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set
            to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and
            your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
            values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the
            language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
            the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English).
            Although optional, you should always specify the language.
            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a
            different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language header
            are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface
            string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface.
            There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects.
            Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
            apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='textDecorations'>
            A Boolean value that determines whether display strings should
            contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting characters. If
            true, the strings may include markers. The default is false. To
            specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the
            markers, see the textFormat query parameter.
            </param>
            <param name='textFormat'>
            The type of markers to use for text decorations (see the
            textDecorations query parameter). Possible values are Raw—Use
            Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting.
            The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For
            example, Bing uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of
            query terms for hit highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark
            content that needs special formatting. For example, use &lt;b&gt;
            tags to highlight query terms in display strings. The default is
            Raw. For display strings that contain escapable HTML characters
            such as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing
            escapes the characters as appropriate (for example, &lt; is escaped
            to &amp;lt;). Possible values include: 'Raw', 'Html'
            </param>
            <param name='customHeaders'>
            The headers that will be added to request.

            The user's search query term. The term may not be empty. The term may
            contain Bing Advanced Operators. For example, to limit results to a
            specific domain, use the site: operator.
            </param>
            <param name='acceptLanguage'>
            A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface
            strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference. For additional
            information, including expected format, see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
            header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not
            specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc query
            parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds from the
            list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to determine
            the market to return results for. If the list does not include a supported
            language, Bing will find the closest language and market that supports the
            request, and may use an aggregated or default market for the results
            instead of a specified one. You should use this header and the cc query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string
            that's used as a label in a user interface. There are very few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Any links in the response
            objects to Bing.com properties will apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='pragma'>
            By default, Bing returns cached content, if available. To prevent Bing from
            returning cached content, set the Pragma header to no-cache (for example,
            Pragma: no-cache).
            </param>
            <param name='userAgent'>
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide
            mobile users with an optimized experience. Although optional, you are
            strongly encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent should be
            the same string that any commonly used browser would send. For information
            about user agents, see [RFC
            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='answerCount'>
            The number of answers that you want the response to include. The answers
            that Bing returns are based on ranking. For example, if Bing returns
            webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches for a request and you set
            this parameter to two (2), the response includes webpages and images.If you
            included the responseFilter query parameter in the same request and set it
            to webpages and news, the response would include only webpages.
            </param>
            <param name='countryCode'>
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This
            API supports only the United States market. If you specify this query
            parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this parameter, you must also
            specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first supported language
            it finds from the languages list, and combine that language with the
            country code that you specify to determine the market to return results
            for. If the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing
            finds the closest language and market that supports the request, or it may
            use an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified
            one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and the mkt query
            parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='count'>
            The number of search results to return in the response. The default is 10
            and the maximum value is 50. The actual number delivered may be less than
            requested.Use this parameter along with the offset parameter to page
            results.For example, if your user interface displays 10 search results per
            page, set count to 10 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For
            each subsequent page, increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). It
            is possible for multiple pages to include some overlap in results.
            </param>
            <param name='freshness'>
            Filter search results by the following age values: Day—Return webpages that
            Bing discovered within the last 24 hours. Week—Return webpages that Bing
            discovered within the last 7 days. Month—Return webpages that discovered
            within the last 30 days. This filter applies only to webpage results and
            not to the other results such as news and images. Possible values include:
            'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where
            the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different
            country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers
            results. The market must be in the form &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country
            code&gt;. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. If known, you
            are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps
            Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If
            you specify a market that is not listed in Market Codes, Bing uses a best
            fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change.
            This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not
            specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='offset'>
            The zero-based offset that indicates the number of search results to skip
            before returning results. The default is 0. The offset should be less than
            (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use this parameter along with the count
            parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface displays 10
            search results per page, set count to 10 and offset to 0 to get the first
            page of results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 10 (for
            example, 0, 10, 20). it is possible for multiple pages to include some
            overlap in results.
            </param>
            <param name='promote'>
            A comma-delimited list of answers that you want the response to include
            regardless of their ranking. For example, if you set answerCount) to two
            (2) so Bing returns the top two ranked answers, but you also want the
            response to include news, you'd set promote to news. If the top ranked
            answers are webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches, the response
            includes webpages and images because news is not a ranked answer. But if
            you set promote to video, Bing would promote the video answer into the
            response and return webpages, images, and videos. The answers that you want
            to promote do not count against the answerCount limit. For example, if the
            ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set answerCount to 1
            and promote to news, the response contains news and images. Or, if the
            ranked answers are videos, images, and news, the response contains videos
            and news. Possible values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches,
            SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you specify
            answerCount.
            </param>
            <param name='responseFilter'>
            A comma-delimited list of answers to include in the response. If you do not
            specify this parameter, the response includes all search answers for which
            there's relevant data. Possible filter values are Computation, Images,
            News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages.
            Although you may use this filter to get a single answer, you should instead
            use the answer-specific endpoint in order to get richer results. For
            example, to receive only images, send the request to one of the Image
            Search API endpoints. The RelatedSearches and SpellSuggestions answers do
            not support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API does (only the
            Web Search API returns them). To include answers that would otherwise be
            excluded because of ranking, see the promote query parameter.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            A filter used to filter adult content. Off: Return webpages with adult
            text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages with adult text, but not
            adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return webpages with adult text,
            images, or videos. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a
            market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict,
            Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site:
            query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult
            content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use
            site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario
            supports the possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
            'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language
            header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
            is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='textDecorations'>
            A Boolean value that determines whether display strings should contain
            decoration markers such as hit highlighting characters. If true, the
            strings may include markers. The default is false. To specify whether to
            use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers, see the textFormat
            query parameter.
            </param>
            <param name='textFormat'>
            The type of markers to use for text decorations (see the textDecorations
            query parameter). Possible values are Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark
            content that needs special formatting. The Unicode characters are in the
            range E000 through E019. For example, Bing uses E000 and E001 to mark the
            beginning and end of query terms for hit highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags
            to mark content that needs special formatting. For example, use &lt;b&gt;
            tags to highlight query terms in display strings. The default is Raw. For
            display strings that contain escapable HTML characters such as &lt;, &gt;,
            and &amp;, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes the characters as
            appropriate (for example, &lt; is escaped to &amp;lt;). Possible values
            include: 'Raw', 'Html'
            </param>

            </param>
            <param name='acceptLanguage'>
            A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface
            strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference. For additional
            information, including expected format, see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
            header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not
            specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc query
            parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds from the
            list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value to determine
            the market to return results for. If the list does not include a supported
            language, Bing will find the closest language and market that supports the
            request, and may use an aggregated or default market for the results
            instead of a specified one. You should use this header and the cc query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt and setLang query parameters. A user interface string is a string
            that's used as a label in a user interface. There are very few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Any links in the response
            objects to Bing.com properties will apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='pragma'>
            By default, Bing returns cached content, if available. To prevent Bing from
            returning cached content, set the Pragma header to no-cache (for example,
            Pragma: no-cache).
            </param>
            <param name='userAgent'>
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide
            mobile users with an optimized experience. Although optional, you are
            strongly encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent should be
            the same string that any commonly used browser would send. For information
            about user agents, see [RFC
            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.

            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='answerCount'>
            The number of answers that you want the response to include. The answers
            that Bing returns are based on ranking. For example, if Bing returns
            webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches for a request and you set
            this parameter to two (2), the response includes webpages and images.If you
            included the responseFilter query parameter in the same request and set it
            to webpages and news, the response would include only webpages.
            </param>
            <param name='countryCode'>
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This
            API supports only the United States market. If you specify this query
            parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this parameter, you must also
            specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first supported language
            it finds from the languages list, and combine that language with the
            country code that you specify to determine the market to return results
            for. If the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing
            finds the closest language and market that supports the request, or it may
            use an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified
            one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
            the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and the mkt query
            parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='count'>
            The number of search results to return in the response. The default is 10
            and the maximum value is 50. The actual number delivered may be less than
            requested.Use this parameter along with the offset parameter to page
            results.For example, if your user interface displays 10 search results per
            page, set count to 10 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For
            each subsequent page, increment offset by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). It
            is possible for multiple pages to include some overlap in results.
            </param>
            <param name='freshness'>
            Filter search results by the following age values: Day—Return webpages that
            Bing discovered within the last 24 hours. Week—Return webpages that Bing
            discovered within the last 7 days. Month—Return webpages that discovered
            within the last 30 days. This filter applies only to webpage results and
            not to the other results such as news and images. Possible values include:
            'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where
            the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different
            country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers
            results. The market must be in the form &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country
            code&gt;. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. If known, you
            are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps
            Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If
            you specify a market that is not listed in Market Codes, Bing uses a best
            fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change.
            This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not
            specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='offset'>
            The zero-based offset that indicates the number of search results to skip
            before returning results. The default is 0. The offset should be less than
            (totalEstimatedMatches - count). Use this parameter along with the count
            parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface displays 10
            search results per page, set count to 10 and offset to 0 to get the first
            page of results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 10 (for
            example, 0, 10, 20). it is possible for multiple pages to include some
            overlap in results.
            </param>
            <param name='promote'>
            A comma-delimited list of answers that you want the response to include
            regardless of their ranking. For example, if you set answerCount) to two
            (2) so Bing returns the top two ranked answers, but you also want the
            response to include news, you'd set promote to news. If the top ranked
            answers are webpages, images, videos, and relatedSearches, the response
            includes webpages and images because news is not a ranked answer. But if
            you set promote to video, Bing would promote the video answer into the
            response and return webpages, images, and videos. The answers that you want
            to promote do not count against the answerCount limit. For example, if the
            ranked answers are news, images, and videos, and you set answerCount to 1
            and promote to news, the response contains news and images. Or, if the
            ranked answers are videos, images, and news, the response contains videos
            and news. Possible values are Computation, Images, News, RelatedSearches,
            SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages. Use only if you specify
            answerCount.
            </param>
            <param name='responseFilter'>
            A comma-delimited list of answers to include in the response. If you do not
            specify this parameter, the response includes all search answers for which
            there's relevant data. Possible filter values are Computation, Images,
            News, RelatedSearches, SpellSuggestions, TimeZone, Videos, Webpages.
            Although you may use this filter to get a single answer, you should instead
            use the answer-specific endpoint in order to get richer results. For
            example, to receive only images, send the request to one of the Image
            Search API endpoints. The RelatedSearches and SpellSuggestions answers do
            not support a separate endpoint like the Image Search API does (only the
            Web Search API returns them). To include answers that would otherwise be
            excluded because of ranking, see the promote query parameter.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            A filter used to filter adult content. Off: Return webpages with adult
            text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages with adult text, but not
            adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return webpages with adult text,
            images, or videos. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a
            market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict,
            Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site:
            query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult
            content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use
            site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario
            supports the possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
            'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. This parameter and the Accept-Language
            header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
            is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='textDecorations'>
            A Boolean value that determines whether display strings should contain
            decoration markers such as hit highlighting characters. If true, the
            strings may include markers. The default is false. To specify whether to
            use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers, see the textFormat
            query parameter.
            </param>
            <param name='textFormat'>
            The type of markers to use for text decorations (see the textDecorations
            query parameter). Possible values are Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark
            content that needs special formatting. The Unicode characters are in the
            range E000 through E019. For example, Bing uses E000 and E001 to mark the
            beginning and end of query terms for hit highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags
            to mark content that needs special formatting. For example, use &lt;b&gt;
            tags to highlight query terms in display strings. The default is Raw. For
            display strings that contain escapable HTML characters such as &lt;, &gt;,
            and &amp;, if textFormat is set to HTML, Bing escapes the characters as
            appropriate (for example, &lt; is escaped to &amp;lt;). Possible values
            include: 'Raw', 'Html'
            </param>
            <param name='cancellationToken'>
            The cancellation token.
